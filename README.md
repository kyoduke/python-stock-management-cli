# Stock Management System (CREG)

## Overview
This Stock Management System, also known as CREG, is a command-line application developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming class at university. It provides basic functionality for managing product inventory, including adding products, updating stock quantities, and removing products.

## Features
- List all products in stock
- Add new products to the inventory
- Update stock quantities (add or remove)
- Remove products from the inventory
- Simple command-line interface

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main Python files:

1. `classes.py`: Contains the class definitions for `Product` and `ProductStockManagement`.
2. `main.py`: Implements the user interface and program logic.

### Classes
- `Product`: Represents individual products with attributes like name, price, and stock quantity.
- `ProductStockManagement`: Manages the collection of products and provides methods for stock operations.

## How to Use
1. Run `main.py` to start the application.
2. Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations:
   - List products
   - Add a new product
   - Update stock quantities
   - Remove a product
   - Exit the program

## Technical Details
- Developed in Python
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts
- Uses basic data structures (lists) for inventory management
- Implements a simple command-line interface for user interaction

## Future Improvements
- Add data persistence (e.g., saving to a file or database)
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs
- Enhance the user interface with more features and better formatting

## Acknowledgements
This project was created as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course at Universidade de Vassouras. It serves as a practical application of the concepts learned in class and as a portfolio piece demonstrating my programming skills.
